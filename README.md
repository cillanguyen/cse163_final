CSE 163 FINAL:
- You should write instructions for us to run your project to reproduce your results. Tell us which Python modules to run to get your results and anything else we need to do to run them.

- If there is anything we need to do to set up your project, like install libraries or how to download your data (if you did not submit it), give us instructions for how to do so.

- Anything else we need to know about running your project!

Must be DETAILED enough that your mentor can run your code.
